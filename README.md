# HW-01-Code-Refactor

Making the homework prettier and more accessible. 

## Where to access

Access website: <a href="https://mbpjason.github.io/HW-01-Code-Refactor/">Horiseon</a>

## Accessability

Gave some accessability to images. Alt attributes and title attributes.

## Clean Code

Made sure that code was properly formatted and easily readable for anyone to look at.
Gave detail comments for what sections are what in HTML and in some ways that certain classes have changed in CSS.

## How it compares

Compared to the original it looks the exact same. Nav options at the top will direct to their exact points on the webpage via "a" tags that link to "ids".
