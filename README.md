# HW-01-Code-Refactor
Making the homework prettier and more accessible. 

## Where to access
Access website: <a href="#">Horiseon</a>

## Accessability
Gave some accessability to images. Alt attributes and title attributes.

## Clean Code
Made sure that code was properly formatted and easily readable for anyone to look at.
Gave detail comments for what sections are what in HTML and in some ways that certain classes have changed in CSS.

## How it compares
Compared to the original it looks the exact same. Nav options to the top will direct to their exact points unlock earlier.
